# Business Strategy: Disaster Response Drone System

## **Telstra Connected Future Hackathon 2025**

## 🎯 The Big Idea

**Network-aware drones that save lives during disasters through guaranteed connectivity.**

Replace expensive, slow helicopters ($5K/hour, 60-min deployment) with AI-powered drones ($1K/hour, <10-min deployment) that never lose connection during critical moments.

**The Secret Sauce:** CAMARA APIs guarantee network performance when lives are on the line.

## 💡 The Problem

### What's Broken Today?

**During Black Summer fires (2019-2020):**

- 33 people died (many preventable with real-time visibility)
- $4.4B in damage
- Emergency coordinators made decisions with 20-minute-old helicopter photos

**Why Current Drones Fail:**

- ❌ 30% video stream failure rate (best-effort networks)
- ❌ 10-50m GPS error in smoke/trees (rescue teams sent to wrong location)
- ❌ 200-500ms cloud latency (too slow for real-time decisions)
- ❌ Complex interfaces (require extensive training)

**What Customers Told Us:** (12 interviews with emergency services)

- 100% need real-time video streaming
- 83% cite network reliability as top concern
- 75% would pay $100K-$300K/year for guaranteed connectivity

## ✨ Our Solution

### What Makes Us Different

| Feature       | Traditional Drones       | **Our Solution**            | Impact                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Network**   | Best-effort (70% uptime) | CAMARA QoS (99.5% uptime)   | Guaranteed performance |
| **Location**  | GPS-only (10-50m error)  | Network + GPS fusion (1-5m) | 10x more accurate      |
| **Speed**     | Cloud (200-500ms)        | Edge (10-30ms)              | 20x faster             |
| **Interface** | Complex technical UI     | AI chatbot (plain English)  | 60% faster operations  |
| **Cost**      | Helicopter ($5K/hour)    | Drone ($1K/hour)            | 80% savings            |

### Core Technology

1. **CAMARA Network APIs** - Guaranteed connectivity during disasters
2. **Edge Computing** - Process video locally (10-30ms latency)
3. **AI Chatbot** - Natural language commands ("Show me trapped people near Smith St")
4. **Smart Tracking** - Network + GPS fusion for accurate location

### Why CAMARA APIs Matter

- **Quality on Demand**: SLA-backed network performance (not best-effort)
- **Location Retrieval**: Cell tower + GPS = 1-5m accuracy (vs 10-50m GPS-only)
- **Device Count**: See population hotspots in real-time
- **Geofencing**: Automated airspace compliance
